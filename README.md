This repository contains my Applied Mathematics Senior Capstone Project that I completed in the Spring Semester of 2018. 

Throughout this project, I researched, designed, implemented, and analyzed a computer algebra system for p-adic numbers.

Through the use of the Python IDLE environment, the user can create PadicNumber instances and use them in matrices and vectors to perform calculations.

To download the Python IDLE environment, follow the directions at https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-install-python-idle

To run the P-adic environment, the user should open "RunMe.py" with IDLE (navigate to "RunMe.py" in the Windows Explorer or file viewer, right click and select "Edit with IDLE"). Then select the "Run" tab and "Run Module"  to establish a prime and a precision to be used throughout the session. Then start coding!

I was responsible for writing all of the code in this project through the guidance of my advisor, Dr. Needleman of Le Moyne College.
