This repository contains my Applied Mathematics Senior Capstone Project that I completed in the Spring Semester of 2018. 

Through the use of the Python IDLE environment, the user can create PadicNumber instances and use them in matrices and vectors to perform calculations.

To run the P-adic environment, the user should run "RunMe.py" in the IDLE environment to establish a prime and a precision to be used throughout the session.

I was responsible for writing all of the code in this project through the guidance and planning of my advisor, Dr. Johnathon Needleman.
